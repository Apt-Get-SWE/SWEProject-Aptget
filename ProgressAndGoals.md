### What has been completed in the project
- Set up a local and cloud mongoDB configuration. The local config is used for local and unit testing, while the cloud is used by the actual website. This meets the requirement for the mongo set up.
- Deployed our website through heroku: aptget.nyc
- Created endpoints for login, post, user address, and paramter serialization. All endpoints work on the swagger ui, and have success and failure tests written for unit testing.
- We have a home page frontend written in react js, and have integrated some endpoints to work on the home page.
